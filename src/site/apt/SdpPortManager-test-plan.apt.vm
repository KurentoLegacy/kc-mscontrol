SdpPortManager Test Plan

	SdpPortManager must respond as is described in the documentation. To check that the behaviour is correct
	there are the next tests.

* Offer Generated Test
	
	[<<Test Procedure>>]
	
		A SdpPortManager object is obtained from a NetworkConnection object created
		from a MediaSession object provided by the implementation tests.
		
		This MediaSession object must be properly configured to <<<generateSdpOffer()>>> method
		creates a correct SessionSpec and generate a <<OFFER_GENERATED>> event.

	[<<Pass Criteria>>]
 	
		* Event generated:
		
			* EventType must be SdpPortManagerEvent.OFFER_GENERATED.
			
			* Error must be SdpPortManagerEvent.NO_ERROR.
			
			* SessionSpec generated must have at least one MediaSpec.
			
			* Each MediaSpec must have at least one Payload.



* Answer Generated Test
	
	[<<Test Procedure>>]
	
		A SdpPortManager object is obtained from a NetworkConnection object created
		from a MediaSession object provided by the implementation tests.
		
		This MediaSession object must be properly configured to <<<processSdpOffer(userAgentSDP)>>> method
		creates a correct SessionSpec and generate a <<ANSWER_GENERATED>> event.
		
		For this propose a specific SessionSpec (<<<userAgentSDP>>>) is needed to obtain a <<ANSWER_GENERATED>> event.
		To obtain userAgentSDP <<<generateSdpOffer()>>> is used and all pass criteria listed in <<<Offer Generated Test>>>
		must be passed before call <<<processSdpOffer(userAgentSDP)>>>.

	[<<Pass Criteria>>]
 	
		* Pass criteria listed in Offer Generated Test when <<<generateSdpOffer()>>> is called.
		
		* Event generated by <<<processSdpOffer(userAgentSDP)>>>
		
			* EventType must be SdpPortManagerEvent.ANSWER_GENERATED.
			
			* Error must be SdpPortManagerEvent.NO_ERROR.
			
			* SessionSpec generated must have at least one MediaSpec.
